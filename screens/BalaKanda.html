    Dasharatha was the king of Ayodhya and had three wives – Kausalya (eldest wife. She was the daughter of the King of Kosala Kingdom), Kaikeyi (second wife. Kaikeyī belonged ruling family of the Kekaya clan), Sumitra (third wife. She came from the ancient kingdom of Kashi.) but no children.

The thought of his dynasty ending with him saddened King Dasharatha and he was very eager to have a son who would take care of the throne of Ayodhya.

King Dasharatha visited the royal family’s Guru, Vashistha and narrated his problem. Vasistha comforted King Dashrath by telling him that he would have four sons.

With King Dasharath’s consent, Guru Vashistha summoned Rishi Shringi to perform the Putra-Kam yagna (sacrificial fire for the birth of sons). The gods gave him with a bowl of divine nectar.
